# Specifications for the Angular Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Angular to build the app
- [x] Must contain some sort of nested views - the resource show page
- [ ] Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due
- [ ] Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart - This will be done with upvotes
- [x] Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product - So far all is good, the show page works now.
- [ ] Data should be validated in Angular before submission - This will be done when I finish the new form.
- [x] Must talk to the Rails backend using $http and Services - So far this is done using ngResource. I am using http for the creating of a resource. I think that I will abstract that to a new service.
- [ ] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code - This will be added shortly, copying from my rails blog
- [x] Must contain at least 5 pages - Yup

Confirm
- [x] You have a large number of small Git commits - Yup good at this one
- [x] Your commit messages are meaningful - I feel thats true
- [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message - Yeah otherwise what is the point?
- [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message - I try very hard with this one.
