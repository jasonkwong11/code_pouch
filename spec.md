# Specifications for the Angular Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Angular to build the app
- [x] Must contain some sort of nested views - the resource show page
- [x] Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due - The search feature is now working. You can now filter by category! I would like to hide this and have a transition to show all the categories when a button is clicked.
- [x] Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart - The user is now able to up and down vote on resources.
- [x] Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product - So far all is good, the show page works now.
- [x] Data should be validated in Angular before submission - This is done.
- [x] Must talk to the Rails backend using $http and Services - So far this is done using ngResource. I am using http for the creating of a resource. I think that I will abstract that to a new service.
- [x] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code - Yup
- [x] Must contain at least 5 pages - Yup

Confirm
- [x] You have a large number of small Git commits - Yup good at this one
- [x] Your commit messages are meaningful - I feel thats true
- [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message - Yeah otherwise what is the point?
- [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message - I try very hard with this one.
