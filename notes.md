I need to do a few things to make sure that I can save a new resource.
  I need to fix the create action in the controller.
  I need to update the angular create controller.
  I need to create the form.
    This is going to be interesting because I want to push all this data through the rails api to create the new resource. I need to figure out what is being sent.
