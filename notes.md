I need to do a few things to make sure that I can save a new resource.
  I need to fix the create action in the controller.
  I need to update the angular create controller.
  I need to create the form.
    This is going to be interesting because I want to push all this data through the rails api to create the new resource. I need to figure out what is being sent.

So the next thing that needs to be done is the upvoting feature.
  I want the upvotes to be on the show page - maybe the index...
  I need to create a new js function to update the resource on the backend.

I also need to implement filtering.
  I am going to have everything filtered on the index page using the category.
  Also the search feature should be able to seach by both the name and the category.
